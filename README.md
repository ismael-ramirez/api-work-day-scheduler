This is a work day scheduler for adding important events for daily planning
ideal in employees with a busy schedule for managing time effectively.
This planner displays the current date and time, and also includes timed
blocks for normal business hours... which are color-coded to indicate past, 
present, or future. Anytime a time block gets clicked an event could be 
logged and also saved to local storage. Anytime the page refreshes the saved
events persists. User interface is clean and the application user experience
is easy to navigate.
